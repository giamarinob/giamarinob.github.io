    <h4>Static Vs Dynamically Typed Languages</h4>
    <p>
      The topic of discussion today is a comparison of statically and dynamically typed languages.
       What do each of these things mean, and what's the difference? Is one better than the other?
       We aim to find these answers as we pursue these questions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To start off it would be incumbent to discuss exactly what is meant by a static type or
      dynamic type language. We will start with static typed language. 
    </p>
    <p>
      A static typed language is a type of programming language that implements a method
      of indicating the type safety of a written program based on the text of that program. 
      That's generallly just a fancy way of referring to a compiler. Before a program or block
      of code is run, the text of the code is complied which checks the syntax and makes sure
      there aren't errors. One of the thing a compiler looks for is what's referred to as the 
      type safety of the code. This means the program will check for type errors. Type errors are
      errors that are caused by problems with constants, variables, or methods and functions. This
      will look for things like trying to add a boolean to an integer. Things of that nature. You can't 
      declare a variable and assign it an int then assign that same variable with a boolean. Now this isn't
      an end all be all rule because there are other things that effect the rules like weak typed vs strong
      typed etc, but that's for another discussion. Most importantly a statically typed language will
      check for these things when it compiles the code. This is opposed to dynamically which checks for
      errors at runtime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dynamically typed language is a term used to desrcibe a language that checks for type safety at
      runtime. This means you can type code that doesn't make a whole lot of sense that is syntactically
      accurate. You can run this code and you won't get an error until the code is run. You can concivably
      run a program with code like this;
      <pre><code>
        if true
          return true
        else
          return true * 24 / "string"
        end
      </code></pre>
      This is something that might not ever give an error. This is because the block of code that makes 
      no sense may never actually run. In the example above since the first part will always evaluate
      to true the else will never be run, and, consequnetly, may never cause a problem. The problem comes
      when you have a situation that may almost never be evaluated. Eventually it will be evaluated and it
      may be only then that it is realized a program has a problem. This can make debugging much more difficult
      because you have to make sure you run every bit of code to ensure that everything tests out. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Is one better than the other? That is a topic that is hottly contested in the programming world. 
      There is no concensus which is better, and perhaps the truth lies somewhere in the middle. Some languages
      are implenting both static and dynamic type checking. These are often referred to as soft typed languages. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Static typing will find errors at the time of compiling. This can improve reliability by being
      appropriately checked regardless if the code will ever run. Dynamically typed languages can allow
      for faster runtime code because of the dynamic loading of new code. There are a lot of arguments on 
      what's actually better. I hope this sheds some light on what is meant by these terms.
