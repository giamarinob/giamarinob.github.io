    <h4>Ruby Classes</h4>
    <p>
       The topic of discussion today is to shed some light on ruby classes. This blog will also
       discuss instance variables and when to use them. We will look at creating a calculator
       class and when it may be approporitate to use instance variables and when it's appropraite to 
       use local ones. 
    </p>
    <p>
      If we wanted to make a basic calculator we could do something like this;
      
      <pre><code>
        class Calculator
        
          def initialize(a, b)
            @a = a
            @b = b
          end
          
          def add
            return @a + @b
          end
          
          def subtract
            return @a - @b
          end
          
          def divide
            @a / @b
          end
          
          def multiply
            @a * @b
          end
        end
      </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        In the previous example we can perform some simple calculations to the variables a and b.
        You can see the benefit of using instance variables in the above example. I can do all of those
        functions without having to pass in any additional information other than what I want the two
        numbers to be at initialization. You can also see that the variables a and b are local variables. 
        they are gone as soon as the initialize function has completed its exectution. @a and @b are instance
        variables. Even though they were created in the method initialize, once the method is completed the class
        still recognizes that @a and @b exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now say we wanted to add some additional functionality like raising to a power;
      <pre><code>
      class Calculator
        
        def power(power)
          return @a**power
        end
      </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this case we are taking in another number to raised to the power that will be passed in.
      In this case we used a local vaiable for power because it only needs to exist in the method power.
      It doesn't need to exist outside of the method so we would only use a local variable there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those are some simple differences between local and instance variables. I hope this helps your
      understanding on some key differences and proper usage.
