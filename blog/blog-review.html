    <h4>A Reflection on my Blog Experience</h4>
    <p>
      Today will be a short discussion on my experience so far on my blog and where
      it will be going in the future. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It's been 9 weeks and phase 0 is coming to an end seemingly as quickly as it
      started. To some degree there is a point there; it has only been 9 weeks. That
      being said it's incredible to think about how far I've come in just 9 weeks. 
    </p>
    <p>
      As I mentioned in my <a href="http://giamarinob.github.io/giamarinob.github.io/about-me/index.html">About Me</a>
      I do have some limited experience with coding. I took some Visual Basic and Java
      at community college as well as C++ when I was pursuing my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering.
      I've had experience with and exposure to the logic of programming. I understood flow control
      and iterations before I started DBC. When I was learning Java it was as a tool to the a larger
      concept of object oriented programming, so I knew about using classes and constructors and scope
      of variables, all those concepts before I even started in DBC. 
    </p>
    <p>
      All that being said, I have never used a markdown language before. I never knew 
      anything about HTML and CSS. I've known how to access page info for a long time, 
      but it's always been one of those things where I hit a wrong button and all this 
      muddled nonsense popped up, and I had to figure out how to make it go away. One of 
      the most rewarding things for me was being able to look back on that info and 
      being able to sort of read and understand a little of what was going on. That was only
      after the first week of html. Now I didn't really understand how the styling worked, or
      I didn't really have any understanding of how the JavaScript worked or even what it was 
      doing, really. 
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also something else. It's the integration of it all. How does it all fit 
      together, and how does what you do in one language affect what happens in the other
      language. We have gotten to that a little bit. We saw how to integrate CSS into
      an HTML document, and we've played around with different styling attributes to see 
      how it affects the html and how it's displayed. Just this week we have gotten a slight
      glimpse into how JavaScript can be paired with HTML as well to create and add features
      to a web page. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We have also been blogging about topics we are learning as we learn them. This
      helps to solidify our understanding of these topics as well as broaden that understanding
      by going out and searching beyond what the challenges provide. 
    </p>
    <p>
      It's something that has been a bit tedious at times for me, but a necessatu evil.
      I understand the importance and significance of expanding on a topic. I know it has 
      helped me to further understand a topic to go out and do additional research. I have 
      always been more of a hands on learner, however. It was the same way in college. I 
      got more enjoyment out of the learning process if I was seeing exactly how the 
      proncocples and concepts apploed in real life. So too with progreamming. I understand 
      the benefits to searching and expanding on a topic. I would have rather had, however, a 
      few extra assigned challenges to explore the topic further. That's just how I learn best
      and it's differenct for everyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      As far as where I want this blog to go, I am unsure. There is an implicit expectation
      that we will continue to blog into phase 1 and beyond. What I will be blogging 
      about, however, is anything but clear. Perhaps it will be a blog about my experience
      in the next phases to try and shed some light on what to expect for others coming 
      into this unknown experience as I am now. To that end perhaps I should do the same afterwards
      to show what life is like after DBC. Who knows? 
    </p>
    <p>
      The point of these blogs has been to educate ourselves as well as others, so 
      hopefully I can continue that trend moving forward. I am not sure what awaits 
      me in week 10 or what it will be like afterwards. It's going to be a whole 
      new experience and a world entirely different from the one I come from. The 
      possibilities are nearly endless, so let's go exploring.
