    <h4>Enumberable Method Cycle</h4>
    <p>
       The topic of discussion for this week is a short discussion on the Ruby
       enumerable, cycle. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Enumberables are methods that can act on collections. In order for a class to
        be able to access enumerable methods the class must have a .each method 
        defined for that class. Arrays and hashes are two classes in ruby that come 
        to mind when thinking of the .each method. The .each method is a common way
        we go about iterating through those particular collections. Since those two
        classes have a .each method defined within them they have access to the various
        enumerable methods that are available in Ruby. 
    </p>
    <p>
        You can add enumberables to your own created classes as well, thy don't have
        to be pre-defined Ruby classes. It might look something like this;
        <pre><code>
          class My_Class
            include Enumerable
          end
        </code></pre>
        
    </p>
    <p>
      The enumerable method we will discuss today is the #cycle method. The cycle method
      works on arrays and hashes. The cycle array will pass each item into the block
      of code provided and do some operation to that item. It's similar, in that respect,
      to the .each method. Where #cycle differs is that when it get to the end of the array
      or to the end of the hash it will "cycle" back to the first index or key/value pair.
      It will continue to do this forever if it isn't given a break condition. 
    </p>
    <p>
      A cycle that that goes on forever might look like this;
      <pre><code>
        #This will print the hearts cards over and over
        deck_of_hearts.cycle { |card| puts card}
        =>Two of Hearts
        Three of Hearts
        Four of Hearts
        ...
        Ace of Hearts
        Two of Hearts
        ...
        And so on and so forth.
      </code></pre>
    <p>
      There are a couple of different ways to stop this. The first is to simply 
      tell the method #cycle how many times to cycle.
      <pre><code>
        #This will cycle the array twice
        count_to_two.cycle(2) { |num| puts num}
        =>1
        2
        1
        2
        =>nil
      </code>
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also do it by using the "do" loop syntax and specifying where the loop
      should break.
      <pre><code>
        #This cycle will break at a specific point
        alphabet.cycle do |al|
          puts al
          break if al == E
        end
        =>A
        B
        C
        D
        E
        =>nil
      </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      That's about it for the cycle enumerable. I hope this shows you a little of 
      what the #cycle method can do for you and why some classes have access to these
      and some do not.
