       The topic of discussion today is classes and id's. What are they, what are
       some of the differences between them, and some of the best practices associated with
       both of them. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Classes and Id's are what's known as selectors. Selectors are are used
        in CSS to find elements based on certain values. In this case the selector
        would find html elements with the assigned class or id value. Once it finds
        a particular element with that certain class or id assignment it performs
        an operation on that element. In this case it styles that element based
        on whatever styling commands are associated with that class or id. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In syntax classes and id's look very similar. They assigned in html code 
        almost the same way. "Element class/id="name"s. The only difference
        between the two that one may see is word class or id. That doesn't, on its face, seem all
        that significant. Let's look at how they are defined in CSS. In a styling page
        an id selector is defined using '#' before the id name. The class selector is
        defined using a '.'. So an id would look like `#id-name` and a class would look
        like `.class-name`. Again, on it's face it doesn't seem all that significant. At
        a glance it looks like the two are almost interchangeable. The significant difference
        between the two is in usage. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The usage of class is almost limitless while the usage of id is extremely
      specific. The class selector can be used as many times as you want throughout
      an html document. An id can only be used once in an entire html document. Newer
      browser, in my case Chrome, will still render the page the way you intended it too. You
      will not, however, be able to validate your html code with multiple instances of the same id selector.
      Another big difference is an individual element can only have one id assignment whereas
      it can have as many class assignments as you wish to give it. The final large difference
      is the precedence that is given to each. An id will override an already existing class assigment.
      If you have a block of html code that's being styled by a class selector an assignment
      of id will override the specific styling of the element that the id is directed at.
    </p>
    <p>
      Basically you'll want to remember that if you plan on using a given selector
      in more than one place, even if you think you might, go with the class selector
      over the id. The id is used in very specific cases. You can only assign an id selector
      to one element and each element can have, at most, one id selector assigned to it. You can
      run wild with the class selector. You can use the class selector over and over again
      and you can assign multiple classes to each element.
