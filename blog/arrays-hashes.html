    <h4>Hashes vs. Arrays</h4>
    <p>
       The topic of discussion today is to compare hashes and arrays. What are they, what are
       some of the differences between them, and some of the situations where you would
       choose one over the other. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Arrays and hashes can become easy to mix up because they do have some similar
        features. Like arrays, hashes can be created with empty values. Hashes are very
        similar in function as well. Hashes are basically arrays except that index keys
        are not limited to integers. Where a value in an array is tied to a specific 
        integer key, which is referred to as an index, the key in a hash can be other objects
        including integers. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The key difference between arrays and hashes is that the keys can be objects
        other than integers. Looking at an example is the best way to describe when 
        to use one or the other. A simple example would be an inventory at a store. If the
        store simply wanted to know what items were in its inventory then they could keep the
        items stored in an array. They could go to that array and search the list for an item
        or they could go though it and see what items were currently in the inventory etc.
        If, however, the store wanted to have other information assoctiated with the items in
        the inventory it may be better to use a hash. Let's say the store wanted to include 
        the amount of each item with the item itself. Could they still use an array? Well, yes they
        could. They could use a multi-dimensional array where each individual array was an item
        name and how many they had. You can see how this can quickly get out of hand. You could
        very quickly end up with multi-dimensional arrays that can exponentially grow in size
        and complexity. It may be more prudent to use a hash in that instance. The key itself could
        be the item and that key can point to a value which could be the number of items, or it could
        the bar code associated with the items
    </p>
    <p>
      Make no mistake hashes can also grow in complexity extremely quickly. You could have
      a hash of hashes. Or you could have a hash of arrays of hashes. The list goes on and on.
      Returning to the previous example, say you wanted to include both the number of items
      the item name associated with any given bar code of a product in the store. You can do that
      with a hash. You could use the barcode as a key, and that key would have a value that
      was an array that included the item name and how many were in inventory. 
      <pre>
        <code>
          inventory = {
            17272: [iPhone 6, 30]
            18272: [Samsung Galaxy 4, 30]
            18723: [iMac, 10]
          }
        </code>
      </pre>
      If you wanted to do that in an array it might look something like this;
      <pre>
        <code>
          inventory = [[17272, iPhone 6, 30], [18272, Samsung Galaxy 4, 30], [18723, iMac, 10]]
        </code>
      </pre>
      You can see how the hash code itself is more compact and, in my opinion, a little cleaner
      and easier to read. This is just one example of when it may be appropriate to
      use an array over a hash. You can do a lot of the same things with hashes that you
      can do with arrays and in the end it may come down to what you are more comfortable using. Being
      well versed in both, however, will allow you to be more versatile with your code.
    </p>
    <p>
      I hope that you learned a little about the difference between hashes and arrays. It can
      be difficult to choose which one to use sometimes because they are similar not only in style, 
      but their application.
