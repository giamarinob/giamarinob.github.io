      Version control is a lot like the Vault application for Autodesk Inventor. 
      Except it's more flexible. It allows multiple people to be working on a 
      project at the same time, and they can all submit their work at the same time. 
      It allows you to go back to previous versions if you feel that it's necessary.
      Evertime you submit work, you add a messagae that tags along with the update,
      so you can see where the project started, where it is now, and how it got there.
      Working with version control allows you work on working copies of a project
      instead of making changes directly to the master copy. This insulates the 
      project from mistakes. It allows other people to check the code one last time
      for mistakes before it is submitted. It is a very useful tool.

        Git is a very useful tool to track the changes you make. By utilizing version
        control, git makes it easy to see the history of a file through the various
        snapshots that are taken each time a file is edited. You can do this by 
        through commits. Commits are an action or collection of actions that are taken
        to modify a file. Then those actions are committed, the current version as
        well as the previous versions are available to view. It allows you to see
        what you've changed throughout the history of the file. 
        
        While you're in the terminal and making changes, git status is a useful
        command to show you what, if any, files have been modified or are untracked.
        It also tells you what you need to do to move those files to a commit or what
        the next stage is for those files.

        Github is important because it allows you to implement version control
        in a collaborative enviornment. Git only allows you to access those files
        which you are editing in a local setting. You can only access those by 
        physically being on the computer that those files are stored. Github and 
        other related services allow the user to access those files from any computer
        that has an internet connection. It also means that you can work on projects
        with any number of people, and they can all access the files via the internet.
        It is far more efficient than having to pass around a master copy and everyone
        only being able to implement their work one person at a time. The environment
        that Github creates is far more efficient than the one just described.
        
        It also gives access to an immense swath of ideas and perspectives that you 
        otherwise would not had you only been working on your own computer. People
        can view your code and offer tips or advice which can benefit your development
        in the long run.
