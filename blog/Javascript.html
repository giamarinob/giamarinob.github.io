    <h4>Ruby Hashes vs. Javascript Objects</h4>
    <p>
       The topic of discussion today is to compare hashes in Ruby to objects in Javascript. What are they, what are
       some of the differences between them, and some of the similarities.
    </p>
    <p>
        To start with let's look at a JS object and a Ruby hash side by side.
        <pre><code>
          
          ben = {name: "Ben", age: 28, hobby: "rockets"}
          var ben = {name: "Ben", age: 28, hobby: "rockets"};
        </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        They look awfully similar. You can tell the second one is the JS object because
        it has the "var" command in front of it which is used in variable declaration. 
        It also has the ";" at the end which is JS's equivalent of putting a period at the 
        end of sentence. Now how about accessing those variables?
    </p>
    <p>
      <pre><code>
        ben[:hobby]
        ben.hobby;
      </code></pre> 
      You can see again they are somewhat similar; A little less so than the declaration statements. 
      The first one is the Ruby hash using symbols as the key to access the value. The second one
      is the JS object using dot notation to access the value of hobby. JS also has its own bracket notation,
       however, so let's see what that looks like.
      <pre>
        <code>
          ben[:hobby]
          ben["hobby"];
        </code>
      </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      Well it's starting to get a little harder to tell the difference between the two. Again, 
      the Ruby hash is on top using symbols as a key to reference a value. The bottom example is 
      a JS object now using the bracket notation to reference the value for hobby. Well what if you use 
      a Ruby hash with strings as keys? Well the declaration would look something like this;
      <pre><code>
        ben = {"name" => "Ben", "age" => 28, "hobby" => "rockets"}
      </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      So that is the declaration of a hash using strings. You revert to the rocket notation (The little '=>' 
      is reffered to as a rocket). What does it look like to access to value comapred to JS objects with bracket notation?
    </p>
    <p>
      <pre><code>
        ben["hobby"]
        ben["hobby"];
      </code></pre>
      Oh boy. Good luck telling the difference there. If it wasn't for the fact that JS
      uses semi-colons at the end of line youwouldn't be able to tell the difference. 
    </p>
    <p>
      We see how similar the JS object and Ruby hash can be from a syntax point of view as 
      far as declaring them and accessing the key/value pairs within them.
    </p>
    <p>
      So what's the difference? Well a significant difference is how the respective languages 
      handles objects. JS considers other functions to be objects themselves where Ruby does not.
      This means you can actually put functions within an object in JS. You cannot have functions, 
      what Ruby refers to as 'methods', inside of a hash. It is syntactically impossible.
    </p>
    <p>
      That means you can have an object that looks something like this;
      <pre><code>
        var ben = {
          name: "Ben",
          age: 28,
          hobby: "rockets",
          whoAmI: function() {
            console.log(name + age + hobby);
          }
        }
      </code></pre>
      I access that function with dot notation.
      <pre><code>
        ben.whoAmI;
      </code></pre>
    </p>
    <p>
      When I call that function it will perform whatever block of code I have set aside
      for that function. Pretty neat, huh?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well I hope that sheds some light on the subject of hashes vs objects in Ruby and JS, respectively.
      We saw how very similar they can get with accessing variables (down to a semicolon), and how similar
      they can look when declaring them. A major difference, however, is that JS objects can contain functions, 
      and Ruby hashes cannot contain methods.
