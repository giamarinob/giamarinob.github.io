  <!--
  -How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  
   It was fun. I really wasn't understanding wireframing that well so it was very
   beneficial to work with someone and be able to explain and work through problems
   together. 
  
  -Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  
  At first I did not, but the more I do it the more helpful it becomes. 
  
  -What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe? 
  
  We tried to keep the layout simple first and foremost. We decided, also, to keep
  things relatively traditional. We had a header, body, footer layout which is
  simple and common. We included buttons for navigation and put social networking buttons
  in the footer. 
  
  -What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?\
  
  Header and footer were new elements that we used. We looked up how to use
  them using links provided in earlier challenges.
