##What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I learned how to use these things to spacially position elements relative to other
elements. By manipulating these styles you can create space so the page does not
look so cluttered. 

##What did you learn about CSS positioning?

Positioning is very important. First you have to select the correct position to
do what you want to do. If you pick the wrong one you may not be able to move an element 
the way that you want. Sometimes it will result on elements farther fown the page 
jumping to a place they aren't supposed to be if you choose the incorrect position
for an element higher in the html. It is a lot of trial and error. Having the preview
running as I add styling really helps because I can see right away if I'm making a mistake.

##What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

I can answer in one word. Starting. It was by far the hardest part. You look at an
unstyled html page and I don't know where to begin. As I'm adding styling and seeing 
stuff take shape the decisions on where to go and what to style next become
easier and easier. When I am faced with an unstyled page my styling is clumsy. I usually
end up going back and deleting a lot of what I first put down because I restyle something
later in the css that overrides earlier styling, so the first stuff I was putting down
becomes irrelevant. Styling is a very iterative process for me. Get some stuff down. 
See what it does. Add more styling. Delete irrelevant stuff. Rinse and repeat. 

##What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

The biggest thing I learned is that I often add elements to wrap other elements so 
that it makes it easier to style. When I was just doing the html I didn't think about 
divs at all or anything like that. Just put up a basic outline of what I need and leave
it at that. Once I start styling I start adding divs and modularizing more and more.
The more modularized the html is the easier it is to style.
