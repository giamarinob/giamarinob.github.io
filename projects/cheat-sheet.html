    <h4>CSS Positioning</h4>
    <p>
      This is something I really struggled with at first when I first encountered it way back in week 3.
      This is a little cheat sheet is made up from explanations that I found extremely helpful in explaining
      these concepts. There are four types of positioning in CSS. Static, relative, absolute, and fixed
    </p>
    <p>
      The  static positioning is the first positioning option. This is the default positioning 
      of all html elements. An element that has the static positioning attribute will be placed
      W.R.T. the normal flow of the page. An element that has the styling attribute of static
      does not respond to directional properties like top, bottom, left, or right.
    </p>
    <p>
      Relative is the next styling attribute for position. The styling is called relative because
      the element that has this positioning will be placed relative to the normal position of the
      element if it was static. Relatively positioned elements will respond to directional properties
      such as top, bottom, left, right. What's more is that other elements will not move to fill any gaps 
      left by moving the relative positioned element. The other elements on the page will behave
      as though the relative positioned element was still in its static position. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The third positioning style is absolute. An absolutely positioned element is still positioned
      relatively. However, the positioning is relative to the first parent element that is not positioned
      statically. It must be noted that this must be a parent element. It cannot be a sibling element. The
      relative positioning will go up the ladder through parents, grandparents, etc, until it finds the first element
      that isn't a statically positioned element. Failing to do so will result in the element acting as though
      it were relatively poditioned. This sytle of positioning also responds to directional properties such as
      top, bottom, left, and right. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The final positioning style is the fixed positioning style. An element with this style is positioned
      relative to the viewport itself. This will result in the element not moving when the rest of the page is
      scrolled. It will stay in the exact same spot on the screen. This property also responds to the directional
      properties of top, bottom, left, and right.
