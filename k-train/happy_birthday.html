  <h1>Happy Birthday K-Train</h1>
  <h2>Me Not Caring</h2>
  <h4>Jan 04 2016</h4>

  <section>
    <p>
       Well you're 23 and the K-train is ready to leave the station. You are now 
       a graduate and can join the androgynous masses as we suffer through
       the life-long affliction diagnosed as adulthood. Truly, all that lie 
       before you is the rest of your life. Indeed it's already started and the 
       apropos question is, "Do you have a job lined up, yet?"
    </p>
    <p>
       It is also about time you started paying attention to politics. I understand
       that you will have a busy life getting a job lined up before someone can
       ask you about it again. And It is a big election coming up with a lot of 
       significant consequences regarding the future of the country. If you ever
       need some advice or someone to do your thinking for you, I can think of no 
       one more agreeable than myself to offer such advice. In fact, I'd be happy
       to walk you through filling out an absentee voting application with you, or
       just taking care of it for you out of the goodness of my heart.
    </p>  
    <p> 
       What advice I could give you I am not sure. Get yourself a good woman is
       about the only advice I'd be prepared to give and I'm not sure how particularly
       helpful that advice would be to you, specifically. 
    </p> 
    <p>
       Perhaps it would be this; They say you should never find yourself to be your
       own worst enemy. I think it goes deeper than that. Always strive to never
       find yourself as your own best friend. 
    </p>  
    <p>  
       Anyway, in closing, I just wanted to take this time to let you know that 
       I don't care about you. And Happy Birthday!
    </p>
